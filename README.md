== Open:Transformer ==

Open:Transformer provides helpers for composing CSS Transforms. Like old-school OpenGL, transform's all about building matrix transforming stacks; unlike OpenGL, the API is a big text string.

At it's most basic usage, Transformer provides programmatic constructs for building individual stack elements.

Further, transformer provides a very basic `transform_node` construct for :

a. representing a matrix transformation stack or sub-stack,
a. combining a heirarchy of nodes into an aggregate transformation stack.

== TODO ==

A chaining API would be swell.
